# Web Audio API Templates

This repository contains basic templates for Web Audio API projects. At the moment it consists of two monophonic synthesizer starter patches - one with a single oscillator, and another with three oscillators. The single oscillator patch has some UI elements, while the tri-oscillator patch is still pretty barebones. They are both still in their infancy and have some bugs to be worked out, but if you need some structure to reference as you get started with a project, I encourage you to build from here. I have high hopes for the potential that lies within to use with future projects.

## Getting Started

Just download the repo, navigate to the template you prefer, and open up the index page in your browser!
If the project you're working with doesn't signify basic use on the index page, use the QWERTY keyboard (along the ASDF row for the white keys) to make some noise. Have fun!

### Prerequisites

All dependencies are contained within the project or called from the relevant CDN within the index file. 
At this stage, all projects are written in jQuery and use external libraries for styling/UI.
